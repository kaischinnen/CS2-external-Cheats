# CS2-external-Cheats

A Collection for several external Cheats for Counter Strike 2. 

## Usage
1. Do *not* use any Cheats on VAC-Secured Servers
2. Start the Game with "-insecure" Parameter which disallows any you of joining any VAC-Secured Server and also takes the risk of VAC ever detecting external Cheatware

## Notice
1. /src/allCheats include a collection of all, so far implemented cheats with an aesthetic Gui, meanwhile the other subdirs of src are an individual, seperate implementation of each method.

Work in prgress:
- script to automatically update offsets after a game update
- esp
- noRecoil
