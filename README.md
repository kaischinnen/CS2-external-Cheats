# CS2-external-Cheats

## Disclaimer
1. Do *not* use any Cheats on VAC-Secured Servers. This programm is for educational purposes only. 
2. Start the Game with "-insecure" Parameter which disallows any you of joining VAC-Secured Servers and therefore takes the risk of VAC ever detecting external Cheatware resuling in a ban.

## Notice
/src/allCheats include a collection of all, of so far, implemented Cheats with an aesthetic Gui, while the other subdirs of src are an individual, seperate implementation of each method.
