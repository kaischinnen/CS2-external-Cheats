## Disclaimer
1. Do *not* use any Cheats on VAC-Secured Servers. This program is for educational purposes only. 
2. Start CS2 with "-insecure" parameter which disallows any you of joining VAC-Secured Servers and therefore taking the risk of VAC ever detecting external Cheatware resuling in a ban.

## Getting started 
Download this Repository by forking it or downloading and unpacking the ZIP. 

## Usage
Ensure the game process is running (being in the main menu will suffice).
If running on Windows:
```
cd ~\src\cs2cheats\publish\windows
./CS2Cheats-exe
```
If you are running CS2 on any other OS than Windows, you will have to to build the solution `src/cs2cheats.sln` by yourself. [.NET][.net-link] is a prerequisite.
